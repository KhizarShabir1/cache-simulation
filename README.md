# cache-simulation
This project is simulation of the Level-1 cache. The implementation is able to simulate direct-mapped, set-associative and fully associative unified and split Level-1 caches.

### Problem Statement
In this project you will implement a trace driven Level-1 data cache simulator and run a set of experiments using
your simulator. The simulator is known as a trace-driven simulator because it takes as input a trace of events, in
this case memory references. The traces, which are provided for you, were acquired on another machine. Once
acquired, they can be used to drive simulation studies. In this project, the memory reference events specified
in the trace(s) given to you will be used by your simulator to drive the movement of data into and out of the
cache, thus simulating its behavior. Trace-driven simulators are very effective for studying caches. By the end
of the semester you will become familiar with the working of caches and how to evaluate their performance. To
achieve these goals, you will implement a cache simulator and validate its correctness. You will use your cache
simulator to study many different cache organizations and management policies discussed during the lectures.
